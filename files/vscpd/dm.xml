<!-- This files holds the decion matrix for the daemon -->
<!-- The matrix consist of the following items -->
<!-- row - one for each decion matrix row -->
<!--     mask - standard VSCP level II mask -->
<!--     filter - standard VSCP level II filter -->
<!--     control - standard VSCP level II 32-bit control value -->
<!--     action - VSCP daemon specific 32-bit action code. -->
<!--     time - Determines the time when the action is allwed to occur -->
<!--            This method parse a string on the form YYYY:MM:DD HH:MM:SS. Both parts can -->
<!--            be replaced with a '*' to indicate that it is a no care meaning that * * is -->
<!--            for all dates and all time while * HH:MM:SS is for all dates but a specific times. -->
<!--            Furter all elemenst such as YYYY, MM, DD, HH, MM, SS can be replaced with a * to -->
<!--            represent a no care for each where it's present. Each can also be given as a list -->
<!--            seperated with '/' characters to indicate several choices. So YYYY:MM:DD HH:0/5/10;SS -->
<!--            means the action should be performed on a specific date and hour on every full hour, five -->
<!--            minutes past and ten minutes past.-->
