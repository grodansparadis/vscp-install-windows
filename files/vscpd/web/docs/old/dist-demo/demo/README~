This folder contains some simple test examples for the websocket interface of the VSCP daemon. Copy all files in this directory to /srv/vscp/www to test 

On a local machine

use http://127.0.0.1:7681/hi.html

to test if the VSCP daemon can server plain HTML files. Then use

http://127.0.0.1:7681/test.html

to test the websocket interface.

The VSCP daemon as default looks for files to serve to user at

/srv/vscp/www

and listens on the standard websoket port 7681. If you want to change any of this you should modify the lines

	<!-- Path to server root file system -->
        <!-- Server should have read/write access to this location -->
        <rootpath>/srv/vscp/www</rootpath>

        <websockets enable="true" port="7681" />

in the vscpd configuration file (/etc/vscp/vscpd.conf) appropriatly.
