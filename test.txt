This is a file that is located in the installation of your VSCP & Friends installation. 
It is opended every ten seconds in notepad by the an internal event in the
decison matrix of the VSCP daemon.

We understand that you dont want this. To remove it edit the dm.xml file 
(normally at C:\ProgramData\vscp or similar ) and remove the entry (or delete the dm.xml). 

Read more about the powerful internal decison matrix of the VSCP daemon in
part 15.7 of the documentation.

Cheers
